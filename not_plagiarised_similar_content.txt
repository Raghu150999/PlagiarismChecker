Math is so cool that you can use a simple iterative algorithm and calculate the PageRank score of a page without knowing the value of other pages that link to it. How does it work? Each time we run the calculation, we are getting a closer estimate of the final value. We remember each calculated value and repeat the calculations a number of times till the numbers stop changing much.

In order to prevent some pages from having too much influence, the PageRank formula also uses a dampening factor. According to the theory, there's an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links, gets bored at some point, and stops clicking. The probability that this person will continue clicking at any step is a dampening factor. In the formula, the total value of pages is damped down by multiplying it by 0.85 (a generally assumed value).

It's also considered that the average sum of all pages equals one. Thus, even if a page has no backlinks (i.e., no votes), it still gets a small score of 0.15 (one minus a dampening factor).

It's believed that Google recalculates PageRank scores after each crawl of the Web. As it expands, the initial approximation of PageRank decreases for all documents. Most probably, PageRank favors older pages as new pages cannot have a big profile of quality backlinks, so they receive lower scores.
