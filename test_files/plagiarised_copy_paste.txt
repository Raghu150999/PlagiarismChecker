The PageRank algorithm used by google harnesses the implicit collective
intelligence present in the structure of the world wide web. Any page on
the Internet will generally link to at least one other, by modelling this
link structure as a graph, we can build up a symbolic representation of
the world wide web.
Expanding on this theory, we can then say that the links from an important
pages are themselves more important. Using this idea we can adjust the
rankings of our pages so that pages linked to be the most important pages
are considered more relevant.
The actual Google PageRank algorithm is much more complex than this, but
follows the same underlying principles. It incorporates some more advanced
reasoning to avoid website creators exploiting their knowledge of the algorithm
to artificially increase their PageRank through use of web-rings and other
similar reciprocal hyperlinking schemes.

inheritance in object oriented programming is where a new class is formed using classes which have allready been defined. These classes have have some of the behavior and attributes which where existent in the classes that it inherited from. The peropos of inheritance in object oriented programming is to minimize the reuse of existing code without modification.
The advantage of inheritance is that classes which would otherwise have alot of similar code , can instead shair the same code, thus reducing the complexity of the program. Inheritance, therefore, can also be refered to as polymorphism which is where many pieces of code are controled by shared control code.
