The definition of term depends on the application. Typically terms are single words, keywords, or longer phrases. If the words are chosen to be the terms, the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary A document is represented as a vector. Each dimensions corresponds to a separate terms. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero.
Relevancy rankings of documents in a keyword search can be calculated, using the assumptions of document similarities theory, by comparing the deviation of angles between each document vector and the original query vector where the query is represented as same kind of vector as the documents.

Since the develop of the Web 2.0, Google as one of the most popular search engine in the world,  there are many algorithms in the web search. Accordingly, implementations of link analysis algorithms will typical discount such “internal” links. The word computer can be exploited by web search engines such as Google. Thus, the web is just like a graph, and the PageRank, which is our first technique for analysing the link which is  assigns to every node in
the web graph a numerical score between 0 and 1. Since the PageRank is the most important algorithms which is used in the Google engine. For example, there are four pages group: A, B, C and D. If every page link to A, then  A’s PageRank value shoule be the total value of  B, C and D .
PR(A) = PR(B) + PR(C) + PR(D)
